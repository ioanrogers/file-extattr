File-ExtAttr version 0.05
=========================

File::ExtAttr is a Perl module providing access to the extended attributes
of files.

Extended attributes are metadata associated with a file.
Examples are access control lists (ACLs) and other security parameters.
But users can add their own key=value pairs.

Extended attributes may not be supported by your operating system.
This module is aimed at Linux, Unix or Unix-like operating systems
(e.g.: Mac OS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD).

Extended attributes may also not be supported by your filesystem
or require special options to be enabled for a particular filesystem
(e.g. "mount -o user_xattr /dev/hda1 /some/path").

Please see the POD documentation for more detailed information
("perldoc File::ExtAttr").
