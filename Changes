Revision history for Perl extension File::ExtAttr.

1.00 2006-10-02

    - (richdawe) Add support for Solaris 10.

    - (richdawe) Add support for File::ExtAttr::Tie on *BSD.

    - (richdawe) API change: Namespace and the create/replace flag
                 are now passed via a hash. This breaks API compatibility
                 for both File::ExtAttr and File::ExtAttr::Tie.

                 One API change remains: using exceptions rather
                 than warnings to report errors.

    NOTE: This relase has not been built or tested on Mac OS X.

    - (richdawe) All *fattr functions now take some optional flags.
    - (richdawe) Add File::ExtAttr::Tie for tied access to extattrs;
