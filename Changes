Revision history for Perl extension File::ExtAttr.

1.05 2007-06-23

    - (richdawe) Fix META.yml so that it's valid. Add a test using
      		 Test::YAML::Meta to the test suite, to validate META.yml.

1.04 2007-05-06

    - (richdawe) OpenBSD does not support extended attributes --
                 fail the build on OpenBSD; documentation updates.

    - (richdawe) Really fix build for NetBSD 3.x. Update the test suite
                 to skip tests on NetBSD 3.1 or earlier,
                 since NetBSD 4.0 is the first version to actually have
                 filesystem support for extended attributes.

1.03 2007-04-27

    - (richdawe) Fix RT #26542: "Tests fail with taint-mode
                 and ATTR_TEST_DIR set"; also document ATTR_TEST_DIR.

    - (richdawe) Build fix for NetBSD, OpenBSD: Use strerror()
                 if strerror_r() is not available.

1.02 2007-04-06

    - (richdawe) Fix listfattr() so it works on Linux. Thanks to rafl
                 and Jonathan Rockway for the patch!
    - (richdawe) Add test cases for listfattr().
    - (richdawe) Fix warning in listfattr(), listfattrns()
                 when operating on a file handle.

1.01 2006-10-02

    - (richdawe) Fix brown paper bag bugs in MANIFEST that broke the build.

1.00 2006-10-02

    - (richdawe) Add support for Solaris 10.

    - (richdawe) Add support for File::ExtAttr::Tie on *BSD.

    - (richdawe) API change: Namespace and the create/replace flag
                 are now passed via a hash. This breaks API compatibility
                 for both File::ExtAttr and File::ExtAttr::Tie.

                 One API change remains: using exceptions rather
                 than warnings to report errors.

    - (richdawe) Fix RT #21214: "ISO C90 forbids mixed declarations
                 and code"

    NOTE: This relase has not been built or tested on Mac OS X.

0.05 2006-05-27
    - (richdawe) Add support for FreeBSD 6.0. This may also work
                 with NetBSD >= 4.0 and OpenBSD > 3.8.
    - (richdawe) All *fattr functions now take some optional flags.
    - (richdawe) Add File::ExtAttr::Tie for tied access to extattrs;
                 thanks to David Leadbeater!
