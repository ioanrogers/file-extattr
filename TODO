todo:
utf8
warnings
check that partition supports it, especially in unit test
docs, explain user_xattr, mount -o remount
change to use section 2 calls instead of section 3
for "operation not supported" note must be prefixed with "user"
buffer size, reuse buffer?
throw exceptions rather than warnings on getxattr() failure
symbolic link handling (O_NOFOLLOW on Mac OS X)
Check it can be used with Perl 5.6.x
Test setting attributes on directories, as suggested at Brum.pm
Factor out common code from the tests
Refactor the buffer allocation into a common function in ExtAttr.xs

Remove dependency on libattr on Linux - just define ENOATTR -> ENODATA?
(Feels a bit evil to do that.)

Unite somehow with File::Attributes (which is for file systems
without xattrs)?

Document pre-reqs for test suite: Test::Distribution, Test::Pod::Coverage,
Test::YAML::Meta. Include these in a .spec file that we can include
with distro

Disallow nuls in the attribute names. The list handling will break
if we allow this. (Alternative is to make the portable listxattr follow
the BSD API, where the separator is a length byte.)

Rename the module?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Or could we just mention "metadata" in the one-line summary
for File::ExtAttr? Then people searching for metadata, extattr, xattr
would likely find the module. Actually, test whether those terms find
the module /already/.

What else would go under File::Attributes::*? I couldn't think
of anything else that would reasonably go in that namespace.
Is it worth creating a namespace for just this module?

The original motivation for this name was that extended attributes
are known as "extattrs" (*BSD) or "xattrs" (Linux).

Thanks.

We (Kevin Goess and I) discussed having a submodule per platform,
but we decided to do have all the cross-platform in the XS.
Haven't /actually/ tried that yet, though. ;)"

There is File::Attribute. It does something similar
but in a completely different way. It creates .filename.attributename files
to store the attribute data.

I wouldn't use the File::ExtAttr name either since it's too cryptic.
Personally, I was well aware that different OS's and file systems support
per-file meta data, but I didn't know what it was called. If I searched CPAN
for that functionality, I'd look for File::MetaData or File::Atribute(s),
but I would probably miss File::ExtAddr."
